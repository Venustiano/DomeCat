# DomeCat 
## A Tool to Explore Astronomical Databases and Transform Data into Planetarium Formats

The Virtual Observatory provides a valuable source for presentations
in digital planetaria. However, importing data into planetaria can be
a time-consuming process because the data must be selected, downloaded
and transformed into a format used in digital planetaria. The later
step is typically done by means of ad-hoc scripts. DomeCat is a
user-friendly tool that can perform such steps on a single graphical
user interface (GUI). Additionally, includes a database to keep track
of the transformed data and runtime of the procesess.

## Installation

The easiest way to run DomeCat is by downloading an executable file for Ubuntu, Windows or MacOSX. The latest releases can be found [here](https://github.com/Venustiano/DomeCat/releases).

### Compile under Linux and OSX

1. Install [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.9-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if not installed and `venv`
```
apt install python3.9-dev python3.9-venv
```
2. Clone this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/Venustiano/DomeCat.git
cd ./DomeCat/src
``` 
3. Run

```
source ./domecat-env.sh
```  

This script will create and activate a virtual environment
`env`, install the required packages and run `python domecat.py`

4. If everything went fine, you'll see the GUI.

5. When you are done close the app. Your current directory will be the root of the repository.  

6. Deactivate the environment.
```
deactivate
```
### Building the DomeCat app under Ubuntu and OSX
1. Activate the virtual environment
```
source ./env/bin/activate
```
2. Run the following command
```
pyinstaller --onefile --add-data "./env/lib/python3.9/site-packages/astroquery/CITATION:astroquery/" --add-data "./config/*:config/" ./domecat.py
```
3. Run the app

```
./dist/domecat
```

### Compile under Windows

1. In a powershell window, clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Venustiano/DomeCat.git
cd ./DomeCat/src
```

2. Install [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.9-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if
   necessary and make sure you [add python to the
   `PATH`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html)

3. Create a virtual environment
```
python -m venv env/
```
4. Activate the virtual environment
```
.\env\Scripts\activate.ps1
```
5. If the above command does not work [run as administrator in a different powershell window](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4037939/powershell-says-execution-of-scripts-is-disabled-on-this-system)
```
powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope "CurrentUser" -ExecutionPolicy "RemoteSigned"
```
6. Install the [`sciserver`](https://github.com/sciserver/SciScript-Python) python libraries.
```
cd ./env/
git clone http://github.com/sciserver/SciScript-Python.git
cd SciScript-Python/py3
python setup.py install
cd ..\..\..\
```

9. Install the required packages
```
pip install -r .\requirements.txt
```
10. Run Domecat
```
python .\domecat.py
```

11. After stopping DomeCat, deactivate the environment.

```
deactivate
```

### Building the DomeCat app under Windows
1. Activate the virtual environment
```
.\env\Scripts\activate.ps1
```
2. Run the following command
```
pyinstaller.exe --onefile --add-data "./env/Lib/site-packages/astroquery/CITATION;astroquery/" --add-data "./config/*;config/" ./domecat.py
```
3. Run the app

```
.\dist\domecat.exe
```

<!-- DomeCat has been developed for two main purposes. First, to provide a -->
<!-- user friendly interface to explore and download data from different -->
<!-- astronomical catalogues. Second, to transform data into planetarium -->
<!-- formats. Currently, GAIA, SDSS and ESO catalogues are -->
<!-- supported. Because of the download limitations of the anonymous user, -->
<!-- authentication credentials are requested for SDSS and -->
<!-- GAIA. Appropriate links to sign up are provided when authentication is -->
<!-- required. -->



<!-- Given the appropriate columns or variables -->
<!-- such as `ra`, `dec`, and `parallax` or `redshift`, these data can be -->
<!-- used to generate file formats such as `speck`, `fits` and -->
<!-- `octrees`. Such file formats can be used for visual exploration of the -->
<!-- data using [OpenSpace](https://www.openspaceproject.com/). This tool -->
<!-- has the following features -->
